## Topic

Knowball is a simple game inspired by a simple truth: it’s fun to name increasingly obscure
athletes, especially with friends. So, why not keep score? Our obscurity engine considers everything
about an athlete’s public record, from their statistics on the field to their following off it.
Knowball will show you a prompt, pass your guesses through the engine, and return a score. Play to
find out if you know ball.
