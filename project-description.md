## Topic

Knowball is a simple game inspired by a simple truth: itâ€™s fun to name increasingly obscure athletes, especially with friends.
So, why not keep score? Our game uses sentiment analysis to score the obscurity of every athlete you can name in 60 seconds,
given a category. Play to find out who knows ball.
